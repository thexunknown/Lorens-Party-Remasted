# Lorens-Party-Remasted
Continuation for a mod that ceased production in 2014

Welcome to the Github page for my mod.

Here I will be uploading all the files needed to run the mod regularly, so you can always download and build a copy of it yourself. Feel free to use some of the missions that I made as examples for yours, but do not plagarise. The icons can be used by you with no credit needed. Anything else, please contact me on the Donut Team discord, my username is xUnknown.

I feel the changes that I have made are sufficient and that the mod is in a good state to play at the moment.

A lot more needs to be added, so please be aware that this mod is not in it's final state.
